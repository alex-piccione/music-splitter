# Changelog

## 2026-09-21
- Split output now goes into a folder named after the source file (e.g., `My Mix.mp3` → `My Mix/01.mp3`, …), created next to the source file.
- Removed the obsolete `OUTPUT_FOLDER` setting from `config.txt`.
- Replaced unmaintained `pydub` with direct FFmpeg stream-copy (`-c copy`) splitting: fixes `audioop` ModuleNotFoundError on Python ≥3.13 and SyntaxWarning noise; splitting is now lossless (no re-encode).
- Removed `pydub` from requirements; FFmpeg is now used directly.
- Made split test robust to MP3 duration estimation padding.

## 2026-07-05

- Integrated File Selection and Split trigger.
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback.
